<p>This week we encoded data straight into VegaLite rather than linking it to a an uploaded spreadsheet. We did this through python by importing the CSV, then extracting the raw data in a way suitable for use in VegaLite. </p>
<p>For this week I have used data on fire statistics in Great Britain. In my raw data, I included both the nominal incident rates as well as in proportion to the population. I did this so that I could easily compare and switch analysis when/if I so wish.</p>
